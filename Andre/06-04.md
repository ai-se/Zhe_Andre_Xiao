# Am I On the right path?


### Yes and No
In general, the usage of the usual nlp tools can use Pre-existing expert knowledge or not. By reading papers on automatic requirements extraction. There is a good amount of papers that use Expert Knowledge and that dont.

However while reading these papers one thing became clear. The point of speech acts is to detect subtext in text. And that is recognized as usually a difficult thing to do in NLP. 

So for the specific case of automatic requirement detection /classification in text. The answer is No I am not in the right path. There is a plethora of papers that simply use automatic feature selection or a dictionary (automatically generated) of the most common terms in order to classify and automatically generate rules (Rule mining). Or even simply using LDA and tf-idf to classify the text.

However is there a problem where detecting subtext would be important and the usage of NLP needs the expert knowledge?

The thing is these automatic approaches without a previous knowledge base are in general using counts or statistics on the presence or absence of words in text. When we are talking about the linguistic domain and the usage of ML to understand text there is much we don't know. The state of the art for language processing is nowhere near image processing for example. And one of the things that may cause this is that language is more than the words in the text (eg.: Speech Acts, Intent, Effect) these are all parts of the semantic understanding of the text. 

One might ask then **How to even learn subtext** or **How to do semantic learning**. With the tools I've read so far I don't see a way to do so.
