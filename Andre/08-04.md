### A great number of papers use POS Tagging before classifying the speech acts.

![pos](img/pos-title.jpg "POS")

Pos is a very simple and ""Solved"" problem, using POS increases the accuracy of the speech act classification.

The advantage of using POS is that we can identify the verbs and use verbs that are related to certain speech acts through a given taxonomy.

eg:

![sav](img/speechactverb.png "Taxonomy")

Another great advantage of POS tagging is that with it we can increment a very simple sentence disambiguation algorithm to separate the sentences in order to detect speech acts.

eg:
