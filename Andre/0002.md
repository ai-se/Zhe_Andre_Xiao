# New Domain Work

* Reading Papers on the Topic:
  - Dialogue acts seems like the wider used term.
  - There are ready datasets for using to train and recognize a very wide variety of speech/dialogue acts
     * results are not that great it seems. Have to check the performance measures
  - Summarizing (tell me about) seems likely and possible on a very similar scheme of fastread.
  - There is a problem on how to split the original text into dialogue substrings (reading about it)
* Selection of a training set to try and reproduce some experiments
  - Couple of options from the papers
* Starting to think on a way to model news into dialogue acts.
