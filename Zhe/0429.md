### V&V for Machine Learning:
 - Motivation: in high-tech companies, most software products have machine learning models embedded. The model should also be tested when testing these softwares. 
 - Dr. Ye Yang: should verify if the essential steps are taken, e.g. data balancing? normalization? tuning?
 - Zhe: create test cases for machine learning models so that in continuous integration, those tests are automatically executed to check if the new model is better than the old one.
 
   Background: Google is checking (weekly) the performance of their continously updated model to decide whether it should replace its older version.
 
   What to test:
   + test for performance: precision, recall, auc, f1, etc. 
   + test for fairness: bias metrics
   + human define the user-prefered goal spaces (with examples)
   
   On which to test:
   + a test set: update the test set? how?
   + crowdsourcing: find inconsistencies in old/new model predictions, ask humans which are correct.
   + auto-A/B test: release to 5% of users
