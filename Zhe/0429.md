### V&V for Machine Learning:
 - Dr. Ye Yang: should verify if the essential steps are taken, e.g. data balancing? normalization? tuning?
 - Zhe: create test cases for machine learning models so that in continuous integration, those tests are automatically executed to check if the new model is better than the old one.
   What to test:
   + test for performance: precision, recall, auc, f1, etc.
   + test for fairness: bias metrics
   On which to test:
   + a test set: update the test set? how?
   + crowdsourcing: find inconsistencies in old/new model predictions, ask humans which are correct.
   + auto-A/B test: release to 5% of users
