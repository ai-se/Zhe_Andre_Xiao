DONE:

1. Binary Clustering Algorithm (SPLIT) to cluster builds/test cases. Run all basic algorithms in each cluster. 
Result: https://www.overleaf.com/project/5e8495c3650fa80001d42332.
2. Problem found: APFD results for the builds with more FAIL will always lower than other builds. (Even for optimal A2 algorithm.)
3. Problem found: If we split traning and testing data, and cluster by builds, we cannot know which cluster the new builds should be.
The reason is we don't know how many FAIL in the new builds.

DOING:

1. Select more good projects to run the clustering result.
2. Trying a new cluster way: cluster by test cases.

TO DO:

I can verify the findings by using computational science projects.
