DONE:
1. Improve the code of TCP algorithms. Run TCP algorithms on Computational Science projects.
   
   Results show that B1/B3 still has better performance on CS projects.
   
2. Makeing Build-File sparse matrix. (1122 builds(row) * 2182 files(columns) 0-1 matrix)


DOING:
1. Changing TERMINATOR(F2) a little bit and make it runnable for CS projects. So we can compare F2 with TCP algorithms. If F2 has lower
APFD median and IQR, then we can conclude that TERMINATOR needs more requirements which github projects may not have. For oepn source projects,
 we recommend B1 and B3 algorithms for test cases prioritization (Has better APFD median and IQR than E and F2, fast running time than E). 
 (The main idea of the paper?)

2. Reading: "Sparse Subspace Clustering: Algorithm, Theory, and Applications"

TO DO:
1. Clustering on Build-File table.
