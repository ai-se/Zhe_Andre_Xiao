DONE:

1. Improve the code of TCP algorithms. Run TCP algorithms on SE projects.

2. Get stats for the SE projects. Not much useful information in the current 10 projects (Out of 17). Hope rests can have some useful information.

DOING:

Changing TERMINATOR(F2) a little bit and make it runnable for CS projects. So we can compare F2 with TCP algorithms. If F2 has lower APFD median and IQR, then we can conclude that TERMINATOR needs more requirements which github projects may not have. For oepn source projects, we recommend B1 and B3 algorithms for test cases prioritization (Has better APFD median and IQR than E and F2, fast running time than E). (The main idea of the paper?)
