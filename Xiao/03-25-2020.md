DONE:

1. Binary Clustering Algorithm (SPLIT) to cluster builds/test cases. https://www.overleaf.com/project/5e79e05be4d343000188b30c
2. New algorithm based on Binary Clustering result. (Not good)
3. Preferred algorithm (B1/B3) in each cluster.
   Found: a. Most data is clustered in group 5.
          b. Clusters with small radius has lower APFD score.
          
DOING:

Find pattern for each cluster to see if new algorithm can be developed.

TO DO:

Applying computational science github project in clustering to find more pattern.
